A) 
A stream is a list with an unbound tail, so you can append 
to the stream by binding the tail to a list containing the message 
and a new unbound tail

B)
Not sure :(
Cant find anything?

C)
This forces us to go through the first 10 elements of the list,
since Nth returns the Ith element of X (counting from 1).
Since Lazy Evalution only evalutes once we actually "do" something, we force it to
"do" something with the 10 first elements.

Thus we get the first 10 elements printed, instead of just _<Optimized>
